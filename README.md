- Type problems in natural language
- Automatic problem extraction from images
- Interactive problem processing

#### Intelligent Code Generation
- Optimal solution generation with best time/space complexity
- Clean, documented Python code output
- Type hints and proper documentation
- Edge case handling

#### Secure Code Execution
